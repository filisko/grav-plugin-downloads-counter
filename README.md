# Grav Downloads Counter Plugin

This small plugin will store the number of times a file was downloaded, and the last time it was downloaded.

## Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `downloads-counter`.

## Configuration

The only thing that you have to do is enable it manually or from the administration panel once it's installed.

## Usage

To see the downloads counter information, you can go to `/grav/user/data/downloads-counter` folder and go through the files, or instead **(recommended)**, get the [Data Manager plugin](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-data-manager) and go to Downloads counter section.
