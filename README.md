# Grav Downloads Counter Plugin

This small plugin will store the number of times a file was downloaded and the last time it happened.

## Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `downloads-counter`.

The only thing that you have to do to make it work, is enable it.

## Usage

To see the collected data about downloads, you can go to `/grav/user/data/downloads-counter` and go through the files, or instead **(recommended)**, get the [Data Manager plugin](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-data-manager) and go to Downloads counter section.

If you have any ideas to improve it, just let me know!
